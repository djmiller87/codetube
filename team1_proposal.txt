Project Description:
    CodeTube - A full stack YouTube clone, but dedicated to software development. An app/website where users 
    can share and watch videos similar to the look and feel of YouTube but called "CodeTube". The platform allows 
    users to watch content without being logged in. When users are logged in, they can CRUD videos via a video 
    source link to contribute to the app/website. The videos, website, and all content is targeted to cater an 
    audience that is learning how to code.

    -Django. Hoping to learn and use django, but with time constraints we may have to revert back to flask. 

Project Technologies:
    -Python
    -Django (Flask if Django not viable in time provided)
    -HTML, CSS, JS if needed
    -Bootstrap

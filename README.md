- Demonstrate proficiency with using Git / GitHub on a team with multiple contributors.
- Full login and registration where users can CRUD videos (share, play, edit, delete).
- Platform allows users to watch and search content without being logged in. However access control is implemented to require login authentication to access pages where appropriate. 
- Implemented validations for Login and Reg and Video CRUD.
- Youtube video source link python algorithm to transform the browser video url into an embeddable url.
- Users can like videos and unlike videos when logged in.
- View count increments for every time a video is rendered/watched.
- Videos render randomly when on the home page. Dashboard page renders only the videos that belong to that user.
- Majority of CSS clone styling done manually to demonstrate proficiency in CSS styling.

Group Project Collaborators: Jake Miller, Jason Harrel, Joshua Becker, Sitora Pekker, Summer King

Technologies used:
Build a full stack application / website using Python and Django (HTML CSS Bootstrap front end). 
Want to use Flask if we can't get Django working for any reason. Login and Registration and CRUD per project requirements.

Project Idea:
CodeTube - a YouTube clone but dedicated to software development. Build a full stack app/website where users can share and watch videos similar to the look and feel of YouTube but called "CodeTube". The platform allows users to watch content without being logged in. However a login and registration is provided per project requirements. When users are logged in they can CRUD videos to contribute / add new videos to the platform via a video source link. The videos, website, and all content is targeted to cater an audience that is learning how to code.
